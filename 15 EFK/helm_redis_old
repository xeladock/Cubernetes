NOTES:

This Helm chart is deprecated



Given the `stable` deprecation timeline (https://github.com/helm/charts#deprecation-timeline), the Bitnami maintained Redis Helm chart is now located at bitnami/charts (https://github.com/bitnami/charts/).



The Bitnami repository is already included in the Hubs and we will continue providing the same cadence of updates, support, etc that we've been keeping here these years. Installation instructions are very similar, just adding the _bitnami_ repo and using it during the installation (`bitnami/<chart>` instead of `stable/<chart>`)



```bash

$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

$ helm install my-release bitnami/<chart>           # Helm 3

$ helm install --name my-release bitnami/<chart>    # Helm 2

```



To update an exisiting _stable_ deployment with a chart hosted in the bitnami repository you can execute

 ```bash                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    $ helm

 repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

  $ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/<chart>

  ```



  Issues and PRs related to the chart itself will be redirected to `bitnami/charts` GitHub repository. In the same way, we'll be happy to answer questions related to this migration process in this issue (https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/20969) created as a common place for discussion.



** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

Redis can be accessed via port 6379 on the following DNS names from within your cluster:



snug-pug-redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local for read/write operations

snug-pug-redis-slave.default.svc.cluster.local for read-only operations





To get your password run:



    export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default snug-pug-redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)



To connect to your Redis server:



1. Run a Redis pod that you can use as a client:



   kubectl run --namespace default snug-pug-redis-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' \

    --env REDIS_PASSWORD=$REDIS_PASSWORD \

   --image docker.io/bitnami/redis:5.0.7-debian-10-r32 -- bash



2. Connect using the Redis CLI:

   redis-cli -h snug-pug-redis-master -a $REDIS_PASSWORD

   redis-cli -h snug-pug-redis-slave -a $REDIS_PASSWORD



To connect to your database from outside the cluster execute the following commands:



    kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/snug-pug-redis-master 6379:6379 &

    redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -a $REDIS_PASSWORD
